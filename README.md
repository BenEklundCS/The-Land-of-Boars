# The Land of Boars

## Overview
The Land of Boars is a platformer game developed using C++ and Raylib. https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/ is a strong inspiration for the patterns and techniques used in my project. Here's what I've gotten working so far!

Key Features:

- Developed complex game logic for player actions and interactions with the environment.
- Implemented a custom renderer for background and game object rendering.
- Integrated a sound manager for handling in-game sounds, and a texture manager both using the Singleton pattern.
- Used design patterns like the Observer pattern for event handling and Command pattern for input management.
- Focused on performance optimization, including parallelizing update loops for improved gameplay experience.
- Built in debug and developer menus using the popular ImGui library.

(Development slowed during school semester for Fall 2024... stay tuned!)
